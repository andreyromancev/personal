I have a considerable experience in OOP languages but when I started writing in Go, it seemed like it resisted my attempts to write code in a way I used to. If you want to try (or already started) writing production Go code, this thought might have crossed your mind as well. Go doesn't have many language constructs we are used to and some patterns look bulky and hard to use. The reason is that Go uses quite different paradigms (different from those you have used before) and to write Go in the "Go way" you need to know how to use them. Here I will explain the difference between Go and OOP languages and try to illustrate why some design choices were made in Go.
