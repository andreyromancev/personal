This article is meant for people in the beginning of their career (students, recent graduates and alike), although a degree in Computer Science is not required. What is covered here is mainly related to the IT industry, but most of it should apply elsewhere as the general principles are the same.

Currently, I am a team lead in a blockchain startup and I have 6 years of commercial development experience. I do, however, remember the days back when I was at the start of my career as a recent graduate. The IT world looked intimidating and unclear, and everything seemed unattainably far away. Now, having overcome almost all of the hurdles which once put me off. My aim is to create something which I would have liked to have read, a road map into the complicated world of IT lined with good intentions and real-world experience  A letter to my past self, if you will.

## Gain experience

To be a good lawyer, you need experience in courtrooms, to be a decent surgeon, you have to get time on the operating table. To be a developer you need experience in... well, developing. You are one of the lucky ones, however, since you can gain actual working experience without going anywhere. The only thing you need is your laptop. So turn it on and get to it!
	
The internet is full of guides and lessons that will lead you from the start line, to a relatively competent little coder. Don’t expect quick results, though. You have chosen a field with a very high entry threshold. Aim for 4 to 6 months of intense practice (at least 15 hours per week). It is very individual, but you won’t be able to obtain any useful skills faster, even if you are a genius.

Start from general tutorials, read a couple of beginner books. They will usually lead you through an example project. You don’t have to remember details, just remember that there is a particular way to solve a particular kind of problems. When you encounter those problems, you will know where to look. Concentrate on basic skills. Don’t try to learn as many things as possible, learn things that are expected from a junior as best as you can.

When it’s done, choose a (pet) project of your own. It’s important to be interested. Think of all the cool stuff you’ve seen and make something like it. Start from small and progress towards the ideal state. Show your code to an experienced developer on every step, ask to correct the general direction of your project. Learn development approaches applicable to it. Publish it on github.

After a couple of projects like this you should be able wrap you head around basic concepts and trends in your field. Now you are pretty much ready to write production code under supervision.

## Fail
{{< figure src="/blog/images/posts/gta-wasted.jpg">}}
Being on the first interview might be stressful. Hands are sweating, voice is trembling, concentration is lost and everything you knew before is now bouncing around your head, unable to materialize.
	
It’s much simpler to get yourself together when you don’t actually need the job. Find a couple of companies you don’t want to work in. Get yourself on an interview. Fail it: give an unreasonable salary expectations, ask stupid questions, fail their tests. Have fun.

At some point you’ll feel confident enough. Then, instead of failing, try to pass them. Remember the general questions you’ve been asked and study the subject of these questions later. Do a couple of successful runs (you might score a job offer already, but it’s not required) and move to the next step.

## Get a boss
{{< figure src="/blog/images/posts/mario-boss-level.jpg">}}
Make a list of companies with interesting positions and study them. Find out what exactly a company does and what are it’s values. Figure out what will you actually be doing there. Learn the business basics as well as the technical ones. If the company is in blockchain, chances are you’ll work with cryptography, consensus algorithms, distributed ledger etc. Most likely, you will be tested on the skills related to your future work. Don’t get carried away, 4 hours for company is enough.

Don’t be too picky. You first job probably won’t be the ultimate point of your career, so don’t expect it to be great. In the beginning, you will actually cost the company more money than you bring. Not only your contribution to the project isn’t very valuable but the senior stuff has to spend their time on you. You are an investment. It’s great, if you can find a good company from the first try, but if not, try to make the best of what is available. 

Keep in mind that they usually raise the plank by ~20%, so apply even if you don’t meet all the required qualifications. If you do well on the interview, they will make you an offer anyway.

When you get to the interview, behave like you did before on your successful runs. You don’t have to know everything and they’re aware of it. Don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know”, “I didn’t work with this technology”, “I’m not familiar with details of this protocol”. If you struggle to solve a test they gave you, don’t stare at the piece of paper silently. Think aloud. If you’re asked to explain how something works and you have no idea, say something like “I’m not sure, but I would do it like this...”. You might not propose the most effective or precise algorithm, but it’s much better than nothing. You goal is to show them that you can think.

After an interview, learn the answers to all the questions you’ve been asked. There is a high change you will be asked some of them on the next one. If you are persistent, soon enough you will score your first job. 

## Don’t stop
{{< figure src="/blog/images/posts/freddie-mercury.jpg">}}
IT industry evolves rapidly and changes all the time. You need to develop yourself constantly to keep up. Don’t ever stop learning. In the beginning, the best source of knowledge is your colleagues. Try to learn not only how to do things, but also why and what are alternative solutions.

If you stuck on your task, the first thing you should do is google. Try your best to understand the root of the problem and it’s solution. Read articles related to this topic. If you spent 4 hours on this particular problem with no success, it’s better to ask you seniors for help. The reason for this is you that you will have lots of situations like this, and you should try to resolve as many of them as you can, instead of asking for help all the time.

Be uncomfortable. If you didn’t have “I don’t know how to do this” moments for a week, you are not learning much. Choose your favorite technology stack (or stick to the one you happen to work with) and dig into it. If you realize that you know your environment well enough, dig deeper. Learn how your framework/library/language works on the inside and why certain things work one way and not another. A good habit is to read articles related to your work every day. Keep track of what happens on the “bleeding edge” and who are the key figures in your field of expertise. You need to know the vector in which your industry evolves to see the big picture, which leads us to the next point.

## Become valuable
{{< figure src="/blog/images/posts/dicaprio-oscar.jpg">}}
After a couple of years of reading articles and books as well as developing, you will reach the middle level. This is when you need to start making yourself valuable. It works like this: guys who do the decision making (CEO, CTO, Team lead etc.) need to know the most about their field of responsibility, but they can only keep in mind so much. That’s why they delegate. 

There is no point in delegating work, if delegator controls all its aspects. Every time you take a task, try to minimize seniors involvement in it. You need to be reliable. Start by consistently delivering on the tasks you’ve been assigned. When you gain more confidence, take more responsibility. 

Opportunities won’t fall from the sky, though. Be proactive and offer to do something yourself. Your colleague is absent? Great! Take some of their work, if possible. Make yourself familiar with what others are doing. Seniors are not aware all the details and complications of a particular implementation, but sometimes they need to know. When that happens, they will much rather ask one person than aggregate information from multiple sources. Be that person. Make their life easier.

You should present yourself as an abstraction above complicated details. If you seen as a reliable self-sufficient unit and a source of truth for a specific module, you will be present on all the important meetings about that module because you save time during discussions. This, in turn, will give you even more competence.

Don’t miss opportunities to show that you can be relied on and given more important tasks. Collect leverage. At some point, you will accumulate critical amount. That is, when the development of a project (or a part of it) is significantly harder and slower without you. Now you represent a business value. If the company you work in is in active development or expansion, you will bubble up very quick. Just be sure to stay afloat.

## Repeat
{{< figure src="/blog/images/posts/edge-of-tomorrow.jpg">}}
When you collect a leverage, don’t be shy to push things a bit. Your primal goal is to develop yourself and progress as a professional. Your own interests should always go before your employers. It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t put an effort in your work, of course. Quite the opposite, a good achievement in a project will look great on your CV.

First, you need to consider whether to stay in your first company or leave. Among reasons to consider leaving are: no time for self-development during work hours, absence of the freedom to make any decisions about technology stack or architecture, lack of competence of your colleagues (no one to learn from), absence of good or presence of bad (objectively) development practices, etc.

However awesome your company is, no one except you is interested in your career. You were hired on a specific position and they like you where you are with the salary you have. Don’t expect or wait for them to offer you a promotion. The good thing is, your salary is a small fraction of the value, you bring to the company, so they will be flexible. 

What you should do whether you are leaving or not is scan the market. Look up the average market salary for your skills and get a better offer. Now you can ask your employer to overbid it or give you a higher position. Or you can just take the offer. The choice is yours.

Even if you are not looking for a job, you should consider occasionally go on interviews. It’s also a skill and it can get rusty. You can repeat the whole process up to every 6 months (optimal is every year or so) trying different companies and technologies. Eventually, you will find a job that keeps your mind wandering at night. Go for it, build a great product and don’t forget to always learn
