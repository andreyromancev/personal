I am a professional software engineer. I live in Moscow, Russia - where I graduated from the National Research 
University of Electronic Technology.\

My specialization is in high load services, storage and online data analytics
systems, although I also have considerable experience in working with embedded systems, web services, marketing 
analytics systems and distributed processing. \

Currently, I am working on a distributed ledger in decentralized business networks
at Insolar.
